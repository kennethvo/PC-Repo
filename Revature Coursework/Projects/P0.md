- Your application should handle errors/exceptions gracefully
- Your persisted data must include multiple types of objects from your application
- You persisted data must include at least one many-to-many relationship
- If persisting in SQL, your data must be normalized to 3NF
- Your project should be included in a public git repo
-- that repo should be a part of the cohort organization

-- NOTE: Commit early, and commit often

- Your application must include unit testing
-- Your unit testing must include at least 10 individual tests
-- You should mock any repo layer interaction (We're not actually testing the repo layer)
