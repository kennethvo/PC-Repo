Or like freecodecamp where I'm learning languages and building projects
	- LLMs? trained on datasets
- Alongside that would I learn like the workflow of a company like Scrum or other Agile methodologies?
- I want to here about your sourcing engine how would you progress my software engineering career and how does your mentorship work?

## REST API
- representational state transfer, rules about how you should build a web API
	- `API` is a set of definitions and protocols for helping you interact with a computer or system to get info
		- API for weather service could specify user supply a zip code and the producer replies with the high and low temperature

RESTful criteria
- client-server architecture of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP
- stateless client server communication
- cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions
- uniform interface
	- requests are identifiable and separate from representations sent to client
	- resources can be manipulated by client via rep because the rep contains enough info to do so
- layered system that organizes each type of server

## HR MEETING
- bring I-9 acceptable documents and direct deposit supporting documents
- monday business professional, tues-fri is business casual
- 401k and benefits are later
