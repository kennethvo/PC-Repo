### To You Again
- a chapter where absolutely nothing happens. Main guy walks around and contemplates going into an abandoned parking lot to graffiti and decides not to because he forgot where he cut the chain link fence. end of the chapter there's a hobo that says like "yea you guys are gonna wait another month for a chapter" "huh" "oh nothing i wasn't talking to you" "oh ok"
- i know i love you because i want to keep making that choice again and again over and over with you for you. i will cherish and love these moments with you forever till i die but until i do die i want to keep loving you through everything we will go through

### Love in 6 Hours
- typical boy meets girl story but with an emphasis on time passing in the background. Story starts with the main character asking for the time and each panel shows the time in the background.

### Eden (a final dialogue)
i hate you. from the bottom of my heart i always did. you represent everything that i find unholy and disdainful to my character, so i understand why you won.

NEW YORK
- pictures of me looking mad or upset in the met and in nyc. go back and draw over them

### Because of Me
girl and boy pals live during a time of space exploration and colonization. girl shows little interest in wanting to explore the universe, while the boy dreams of it. 
- story starts with the boy getting called out of work because the girl hijacked a commercial space shuttle and is rocketing to the moon (currently under development, only people on the moon are the construction and science team)
- story for the most part is the boy talking to the girl trying to get her to go home, while she grows more and more content with dying in space
- before she dies a hand touches her helmet and she looks up to the beautiful sun
- the story ends with her taking off her suit and floating away towards the stars
- final segment is them as kids looking at the stars with a construction crew ship flying to the moon
	- was it me was it because of my dream. i wouldn't have left i swear to god i wouldn't have it was just a stupid dream
	- it was never you. i don't know why.. i don't quite understand why i ever wanted to do this but it just came to me
- may be difficult but research suicide, the motives the psychology behind it, and research spacesuits
