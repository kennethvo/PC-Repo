**Retail/Global Commerce Solutions:** Toshiba is a major provider of Point-of-Sale (POS) and retail solutions. Their **ELERA** platform, built on a **microservices architecture**, uses AI and IoT to manage everything from self-checkout systems to inventory and in-store automation.

**Cloud Applications:** Developing and integrating software-as-a-service (SaaS) features for printing, document capture, and workflow management.
**Workflow Automation:** Building the logic behind features like **Elevate Sky Workflow**, which uses **AI/LLMs** (Large Language Models) to intelligently capture, process, and route documents, automating tedious office tasks.
**Cloud Integration:** Ensuring seamless and secure connectivity with popular third-party cloud services like **Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Box, and Dropbox**.
**Security and Management:** Working on features for centralized print management, user authentication (Single Sign-On, MFA), real-time print analytics, and cost management policies—all hosted in the cloud.
