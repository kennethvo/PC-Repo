- Your application must be written in Java
    
- Your application MUST include persistance - in the format of your choice
    
- Your application should demonstrate proper seperation of concerns (using repo/service layers in the app)
    
- Your application must include at least two class objects/models
    
- Your application should continue running until the user decides to exit the application
    
- Your application should handle errors/exceptions gracefully
    
- Your persisted data must include multiple types of objects from your application
    
- You persisted data must include at least one many-to-many relationship
    
- If persisting in SQL, your data must be normalized to 3NF
    

is it possible to only focus on Postgresql? Spring boot or spring data JPA is a bit out of scope I just need it to work in terminal and follow these parameters

TMDb

for the program, can you change it to become a many:many relationship between movies and users. I want the program to log to have the objects be movies and users mainly

Working on a project in terminal that is similar to Letterboxd where a user logs movies with their reviews and scores. I want to implement the TMDb api to have access to its movies dataset and integrate it alongside Postgresql. Keep the project in scope of those requirements. Do not use spring boot or spring data JPA because those are out of scope. Here are some more requirements needed for the project:
 - Your application must be written in Java
- Your application MUST include persistance - in the format of your choice
- Your application should demonstrate proper seperation of concerns (using repo/service layers in the app)
- Your application must include at least two class objects/models
- Your application should continue running until the user decides to exit the application
- Your application should handle errors/exceptions gracefully
- Your persisted data must include multiple types of objects from your application
- You persisted data must include at least one many-to-many relationship
- If persisting in SQL, your data must be normalized to 3NF
  
Alongside everything here, detail and explain how the many to many relationship would work between users and movies (that is just an example of a m:m relationship i thought of, feel free to add more if you feel fit to)
