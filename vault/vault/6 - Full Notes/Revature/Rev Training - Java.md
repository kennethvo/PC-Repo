# Rev Training - Java
## Java and it's Components
JVM JRE JDK

JDK wraps the JRE which wraps the JVM (so download the JDK)

if JRE is about getting the code running, JDK is about writing code, why would we want another copy of the standard library?

Java_Home - it's the value that points to where your JDK is installed.

Class -> Objects
- Properties/fields
- Behaviors/methods

static - is a modifier, changes out the method works.
void - doesn't return anything
linting, static analysis - the squiggle line under incorrect terms

## Variables
float - floating point dec. with it getting to a point where the decimals will be so insignificant
long - huge int vals
short - small int vals
byte - really small int vals
void - usually see them as returns never really as a variable
null - not a zero, there's just no val

## Loops
for each - use as iterable.
edge cases

## Stacks and Heaps
