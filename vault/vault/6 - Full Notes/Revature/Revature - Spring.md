# Revature - Spring

this will be the client and server relationship.
- Application Programming Interface: during the course we use APIs as the server to answer requests

Spring helps us build an API / Client (if we really wanted to), but mostly to build APIs
- changes how we deal with data
	- JPA lets us work with databases easier (ORM)

### Annotations
- add something that happens at runtime, gives us extra functionality during that
	- NOT an execution, let spring read through our code and when it reaches an annotation it adds extra functionality afterwards
- Reflection: spring uses it to recognize our annotations (the compiler analyzing the code before actually running it to execute the written annotations)

http://localhost:8080/api/hello
protocol://server:port/route

/api/hello?key=value - NOT SECURE. DONT ACCEPT USERNAMES OR PASSWORDS AS QUERY PARAMETERS

DTO - data transfer object: be only enough structure to accept 
DAO - data access object:
