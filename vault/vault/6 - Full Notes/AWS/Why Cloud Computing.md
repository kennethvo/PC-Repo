- dynamic and flexibility in databases
- pay as you go, test/use system without committing

On demand delivery - cloud provider has resources you need, when you need them
IT resources over the internet - servers, networks, storage etc.
Pay as you go - pay only what you need

Client-server model
Modern computing is based on the client-server model
- client can use web and apps by requesting computer servers
- server are services like Amazon EC2

MODELS
Infrastructure as Service
- basic building blocks for cloud IT
- access to networking features, computers (virtual or hardware) and data storage space
- provides highest level of flexibility and management over IT resources

Platform as Service
- removes need for orgs to manage underlying infrastructure
- focus on deployment/management of apps
- give devs ability to be more efficient because they don't worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, maintenance, etc

Software as Service
- complete sw product that service provider runs and manages
- don't have to think about how service is maintained/how underlying infrastructure is managed
- only think about how you will use particular piece of sw

DEPLOYMENT MODELS
Cloud
- migrate existing apps to cloud, or you can design and build new apps in cloud
- build apps on low level infra that requires your IT to manage them
- or build them using high level services that reduce management of the core infra

Hybrid
- cloud based resources are connected to on-premises infra
- can integrate cloud resources w/ legacy IT apps
	- if you have legacy apps that are better maintained on prem/ gov regulations require business to keep certain records on prem

On-Premises
- resources deployed on prem using virtualization and resource manag tools
- increase resource util by using app management and virt tech
