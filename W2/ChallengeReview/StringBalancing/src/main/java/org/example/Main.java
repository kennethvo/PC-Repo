/*
You are given a string of length N containing only lowercase letters. You have to make the string "balanced" by ensuring that each character appears an even number of times. You can achieve this by attempting the following operation:
    • You can choose any index i and any lowercase character c, and insert character c at index i of the string.
    • For each operation, you have to print two space-separated values: the character and the index.

You have to minimize the number of operations and print the number of operations.

Note: The character c should be a lowercase letter (a-z).

Function Description:
    In the provided code snippet, implement the provided minOperations(...) method using the variables to balance the string. You can write your code in the space below the phrase "WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE".

    There will be multiple test cases running, so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided. The base Output variable result is set to a default value of -404, which can be modified. Additionally, you can add or remove these output variables.

Input Format:
    The first line contains an integer N (length of string). The second line contains a string of lowercase letters.

Sample Input 1:
5
hello

Sample Output 1:
3
h 5
e 5
o 5

Sample Input 2:
6
abccba

Sample Output 2:
0
